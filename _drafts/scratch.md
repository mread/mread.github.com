title: What DDD isn't
---

Well it's certainly not creating a couple of HashMaps in your code that contain properties that vaguely resemble something that one of your business sponsors mentioned in passing, and calling it DDD. No. It's not that although I suppose that's a start.

It's not even creating a couple of classes that represent business concepts and putting a "public long getId();" method on them that returns a database generated sequence number. I mean that's a start, it really is, but people have been doing that for years - at best it's a relational model of the business domain.
