I work at [LMAX Exchange](http://www.lmax.com) where I help develop a low latency trading venue using Java. I lead the Technical Engineering 
team and my focus is on continuous delivery, fast feedback and creating an efficient working environment for developers 
that challenges accepted limitations.
